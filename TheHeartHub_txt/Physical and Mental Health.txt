Physical and Mental Health
The connection between physical and mental health may be deeper than you realize. Taking care of our physical health has been shown to improve our mental wellbeing; in turn, nurturing our mental health can help us to stay physically healthy. Alternatively, if either your physical or mental health declines, the other will be impacted as well.
When managing and coping with symptoms, it can be harder to be physically active. The impacts of heart disease on your sense of self as well as feelings of worry and depression can be profound. Many people struggle to maintain good health and take care of their mental and emotional well-being.
