The Heart Hub is the patient and caregiver education site of the Ted Rogers Centre for Heart Research.
The Ted Rogers Centre’s mission is to transform and dramatically improve the future of heart health for children, adults, and families across Canada and around the world through an integrated program of outstanding research, education, and clinical care.Patient Engagement at Ted Rogers

Patient engagement is active and meaningful collaboration not only on the relationship between a health care provider and the people cared for, but also on the research we do, the way we design our programs and services, and how we create equitable access to care.

It’s really about putting the patient at the centre in a meaningful way. For us, patient can also mean the caregiver or the family member.
