Working with Heart Failure
Working contributes not only to our financial well-being but to personal and professional fulfillment. Your ability to work may be disrupted by the impacts of your heart function.Â 
Whether or not you are able to return to work depends on your symptoms and the severity of your condition. It also depends on how physically and emotionally demanding your job is. If your symptoms are under control and your working conditions are manageable, full-time, or part-time work can be an important part of your life.
Talk to your health care provider about returning to work. They will be able to talk to you more about your specific situation and advise you on the appropriate level of work for you.
Some people find it more stressful to be away from work or to manage without a regular income. If you do return to work after a period of absence, be sure to pace yourself.
You may need to change your working hours or engage in less strenuous activities. If you are concerned about your ability to perform your job, consult your doctor to see if a medication change would be possible or helpful, and/or with your employer to see if other work can be arranged.
