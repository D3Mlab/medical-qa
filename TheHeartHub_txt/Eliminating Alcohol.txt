Eliminating Alcohol
Alcohol is toxic to the heart. It is recommended that all patients with heart failure completely abstain from alcohol.
Consumption of alcohol can lead to increased fluid accumulation, which puts extra strain on your heart (see section on Fluid Restriction). In addition, alcohol can interfere with how some of your medications work.
In some cases, excessive alcohol consumption may be the cause of heart failure, and abstinence from alcohol may result in normalization of the heartâ€™s function.
If you think that eliminating alcohol is a problem for you, speak to your healthcare provider. They may be able to suggest resources to help you deal with this problem.
