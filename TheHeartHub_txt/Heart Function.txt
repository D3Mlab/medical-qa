Your Heart Function
The heart circulates blood throughout the body. It pumps deoxygenated blood from the body to the lungs where it receives oxygen and supplies the freshly oxygenated blood from the lungs to the body.Â 
The heart is divided into the right side and left side and composed of four chambers: two right and left top chambers (atria) and two right and left bottom chambers (ventricles). Valves separate the atria, ventricles, and arteries.What is Heart Failure?

Heart failure is a condition where the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the needs of the body. It is a chronic condition, which means that is can be treated but not cured. Once diagnosed, most people live with heart failure for the rest of their lives.
