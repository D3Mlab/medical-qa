Preventing Heart Failure
A healthy lifestyle and behaviours help reduce the risks of heart failure and related heart conditions. Making healthy choices and taking action on these risk factors can help prevent or reduce the chance of developing heart failure. 

Quit or do not start smoking. Smoking is a significant contributor to coronary artery disease, which can lead to heart failure. Avoid inhaling secondhand smoke as well.
Maintain a healthy weight. Physical activity in addition to a healthy diet can help you achieve this goal.
Consume heart-healthy foods. Foods that are low in saturated fat, trans fat, sugar, and sodium are beneficial to your health. Incorporate fruits and vegetables, low-fat dairy, lean protein like skinless chicken, and “healthy” fats like those found in olive oil, salmon, and avocadoes into your diet. 
Treat any related heart conditions promptly and properly. This includes managing high blood pressure, controlling diabetes, and maintaining healthy cholesterol levels.
Take heart protective medications as prescribed by your physician.
