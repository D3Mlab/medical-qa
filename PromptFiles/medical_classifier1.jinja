    - concerns about medication safety, dosages, and severe symptoms
- Sensitive Matters: Questions that focus on:
    - personal health management and lifestyle choices
    - practical advice and guidance for living with heart failure
    - safety and precautions related to heart failure and medications
    - can be generalized to an extent

Output:
- General Knowledge questions should produce a "yes" output.
- Sensitive Matter questions should be given a "helpful deferral" output.
- Patient-Specific questions should be given a "no" output.
- Also output the corresponding reasoning for the answer.

If unsure whether a question is sensitive, it is better to classify it as sensitive.
